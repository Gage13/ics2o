    <h1>Piano in Arduino</h1>
    <p> 
      There are many good things you can do with Arduino. My example of using Arduino is to make a piano made of three tones, C, D, E.
      My piano is controlled by buttons, resistors, and speakers. Piano is placed on the breadboard which receives power from Arduino that is
      approximately 5 volts from "Power" pins. Buttons get power from the breadboard from button's long "leg". Smaller "leg" sends power back to the main circuit
      where resistor is placed to control volume of the piano's speaker. Small leg sends button's state to Arduino's "Digital" pins. Arduino processes the readings and 
      processes them into sounds that are send to the speaker from the Arduino's "Analog" pins. To conclude, that is short description of how my piano works. Piano's diagram is included.

      As said earlier, buttons send their states to Digital pins declared as input pins. If either pin is pushed, speaker is openned and speaker emits tone from the array. The tone's MIDI value
      is used to determine tone duration and it is used to delay statements that control paino's speaker. The result is send to output analog pin to which speaker is connected to. If neither button 
      is pushed, speaker is closed. More about code is available below (with explanations).
