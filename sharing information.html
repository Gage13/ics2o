		Welcome! This is third and final website on how to setup you computer for use.
		The topic is how to share information.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you bought a new computer, you need to transfer information from the old one. There two methods on how to do it. 
		However, as we are talking about file transfer between two PCs, these methods may or may not work with operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.
		If you are intending to transfer information between Windows and non-Windows OSes, or intend transfer between non-Windows computers,
		please use guides that are meant for that, not THIS guide!
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, let's discuss.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Method 1: Ethernet cable</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Attach a crossover Ethernet cable. Ordinary cable is used to connect computer with router, not two computers together.</li>
		<li>Open Network and Sharing Center from Control Panel, and click on icon labeled Unidentified Network.</li>
		<li>Next, click on the message that prompts you to change the network discovery and file sharing settings, then click on the option that reads, "Turn on network discovery and file sharing. "</li>
		<li>Type the administrator password for the computer if prompted to do so, then press "Enter" on your keyboard. Both of your computers will now be visible in the Network and Sharing Center window, and you will have the ability to share files and other resources.</li>
		<li>Transfer info! (Once done, disconnect the cable.)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Method 2: USB Mass Storage Device or USB Stick.</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Plug your USB Stick or Mass Storage Device into USB port on your old computer.</li>
		<li>Copy information that you want to transfer onto it.</li>
		<li>Unplug the USB and plug it into your new PC</li>
		<li>Add data from USB to the computer, and unplug USB, once you're done.</li>
		<li>Easy as saying Cookie!</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		That's it! These were methods on how to share and transfer info from one to another computer.
