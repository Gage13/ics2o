				My game, titled as SoccerGame, will be like a small soccer game (football in UK) played between two teams, Canada and Northern Ireland.
				The game will involve user controlling one team of player(home), and computer controlling the guest team. The user controls consist of mouse movements
				but in soon future controls will switch to keyboard ones. The game will begin with fixed team positions that are moved with input from user. There is score counter,
				that records goals made by either teams. The first team to reach 10 goals wins and game ends. A message will be shown based on scores. Moreover, the screen will have a soccer field
				and it will have audience. Plus, sounds are included in this game to give effect of real game of soccer.
				</td>
				<td>Using the keyboard, you'll control the movement of home team, while computer will move the guest team using counter-movements from user. The goal is to score 10 goals 
				while avoiding opponent team. To win the game, you need to score 10 goals. If you want to pause press Space. To resume, press Space again. Good luck!</td>
