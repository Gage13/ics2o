Hello!
This ReadMe will show any game version change, based on improvements or changes that affect game's look and functionality. 
New comments in the code are NOT seen as a version change!
Thank you!

First Version (v1.0.0) was released on April 15th, 2017

Current Version of the Game: v1.2.2 (Previous versions: v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v1.2.0, v1.2.1)
New updates? Yes (see below)

Applied updates: Yes (April 19, 2017; April 21, 2017; April 22, 2017; April 23, 2017)

Update: 1 (v1.0.0 --> v1.1.0)
Playing field will be redrawn to be more identical to real soccer field. The thickness of the lines will be reduced and the playground will be enlarged to accomodate these changes. As a result, more audience will be designed.
Released: April 19, 2017

Update: 2 (v1.1.0 --> v1.2.0)
To make game real, ball serving was changed from mouse positioning to corner serving. Then, making goals is made possible by preventing ball from moving when it hit the goal and it is positioned at the top left corner. Speed is fixed now. Also, game now records scores. New colouring scheme for the teams' scores and new message of win and loss for the player's team (i.e. Home Team) 
Released: April 20, 2017

Update: 3 (v1.2.0 --> v1.2.1)
All of this update was expected to debut in v1.3.0 version. However, some technical difficulties in adding advances to the game such as, ability of the playground to adjust to browser's resolution and the inclusion of spectators' cheering and chanting, have forced me to release unaffected contents of the update today and tommorow. These contests are being released through updates v1.2.1 and v1.2.2, but only one part of that content is released through this update. IT INCLUDES upgraded soccer field that conforms to standard one, albeit partially. Also, the goals have been relocated to conform to new line scheme. The other part that will supplant the other part of field upgrade will appear shortly in version v1.2.2
Released: April 22, 2017

Update: 4 (v1.2.1 --> v1.2.2)
Another part of the promised update have been released today. The contents are added lining that make playground conform to the soccer field standards. As the key part that controls the ball movement is not ready yet, the ball and the public parts of the code have been deactivated until the said control part is not released.
Released: April 23, 2017
